        "  .In Python, the terms **function** and **method** are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings and contexts. Here's the difference between the two:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Function:**\n",
        "   - A **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can take input parameters, process them, and return a result.\n",
        "   - A function is defined using the \"def\" keyword, and it can be called anywhere in the code.\n",
        "   - Functions are not tied to any object; they can be standalone entities in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example of a function:**\n",
        "   def greet(name):\n",
        "       return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   result = greet(\"soujit\")\n",
        "   print(result)  \n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Method:**\n",
        "   - A **method** is a function that is associated with an object. Methods are defined within a class and operate on the instances (objects) of that class.\n",
        "   - Methods always have at least one parameter: 'self', which refers to the instance of the object the method is called on.\n",
        "   - Methods are invoked using the dot (`.`) notation on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "   **Example of a method:**\n",
        "   class Person:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "           self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "       def greet(self):\n",
        "           return f\"Hello, {self.name}!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "   person = Person(\"Bob\")\n",
        "   result = person.greet()  # 'greet' is a method\n",
        "   print(result)  # Output: Hello, Bob!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differences:\n",
        "- **Scope:**\n",
        "  - A **function** is independent and can be defined outside of classes or objects.\n",
        "  - A **method** is always defined inside a class and is meant to operate on instances of that class.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Calling Convention:**\n",
        "  - A **function** is called by its name: 'function_name()'.\n",
        "  - A **method** is called on an object using the dot notation: 'object.method()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Self parameter:**\n",
        "  - A **method** takes at least one special parameter, usually called 'self', which refers to the instance of the class. Functions do not have this.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Function**: Independent block of code that can be used globally.\n",
        "- **Method**: Function that belongs to a class and operates on instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python\n",
        "  .Function Parameters:\n",
        "Parameters are variables listed inside the parentheses of a function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed into the function when it is called.\n",
        "Parameters define what kind of input the function expects.\n",
        "def greet(name, age):\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n",
        "Function Arguments:\n",
        "Arguments are the actual values that are passed into a function when it is called. These values are assigned to the corresponding parameters in the function.\n",
        "Arguments can be provided in the function call.\n",
        "greet(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "#3.Simple Function: Define with def, call by name.\n",
        "  .Function with Default Arguments: Define default values, call with or without passing arguments.\n",
        "Keyword Arguments: Define parameters, call using their names.\n",
        "Variable-Length Arguments (*args and **kwargs): Use *args for positional and **kwargs for keyword arguments.\n",
        "Lambda Functions: Define small anonymous functions with lambda.\n",
        "Passing Functions as Arguments: Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions.\n",
        "Nested Functions: Define a function inside another function.\n",
        "Returning Functions: Functions can return other functions, creating closures.\n",
        "#4.What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "  .The `return` statement in a Python function is used to exit the function and pass a result back to the caller. It can also be used to return a value from the function. When the `return` statement is encountered, the function terminates, and the specified value (if any) is returned to the place where the function was called.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key purposes of the `return` statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Exit the function**: When `return` is executed, the function ends immediately, and the remaining code in the function (if any) will not be executed.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Return a value**: The `return` statement can provide a value to the caller. This value can be of any data type (integer, string, list, etc.), or even `None` if no value is specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Allow further operations**: The value returned can be stored in a variable or used in other expressions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
        "    return a + b  # Returns the sum of a and b to the caller\n",
        "\n",
        "result = add_numbers(3, 5)  # Calls the function and stores the result\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points:\n",
        "- If no `return` statement is provided, the function will return `None` by default.\n",
        "- The `return` statement can return multiple values, often in the form of a tuple.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Example with multiple values:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def get_coordinates():\n",
        "    return 10, 20  # Returns two values as a tuple\n",
        "\n",
        "x, y = get_coordinates()\n",
        "print(x, y)  # Output: 10 20\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the `return` statement is essential for providing the output of a function and for controlling the flow of the program.\n",
        "#5.. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "  .In Python, **iterables** and **iterators** are both related to the process of looping over data, but they serve distinct purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Iterables**\n",
        "\n",
        "An **iterable** is any Python object that can return an iterator. Simply put, an iterable is any object that can be iterated over (looped over) using a `for` loop. Iterables implement the `__iter__()` method, which returns an iterator. Common examples of iterables are lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Points about Iterables:\n",
        "- They implement the `__iter__()` method, which returns an iterator.\n",
        "- They can be used in a `for` loop or passed to functions like `iter()` to obtain an iterator.\n",
        "- They are not necessarily consumed all at once; you can iterate over them multiple times.\n",

        "\n",
        "An **iterator** is an object that represents a stream of data, and it produces values one at a time, as requested. An iterator must implement two methods:\n",
        "- `__iter__()`: Returns the iterator object itself (this is needed to conform to the iterable protocol).\n",
        "- `__next__()`: Returns the next item in the sequence, or raises `StopIteration` when there are no more items to return.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Points about Iterators:\n",
        "- They are created from iterables using the `iter()` function.\n",
        "- They keep track of the state of iteration (i.e., the current position in the sequence).\n",
        "- After they are exhausted (i.e., all elements have been returned), calling `__next__()` will raise the `StopIteration` exception.\n",
        "- Iterators can be used only onceâ€”after all items are consumed, they cannot be reused.\n",

        "\n",
        "A **generator** in Python is a special type of iterator that is defined using a function but yields values one at a time, instead of returning them all at once. Generators are typically used to represent sequences of data that are too large to store in memory, or when you want to generate data on the fly without having to precompute it all.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key characteristic of generators is that they are **lazy**: they do not generate all values upfront; instead, they compute and yield each value only when requested.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How are Generators Defined?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are defined using the `yield` keyword in a function. The `yield` statement pauses the function, returning a value to the caller. The state of the function is saved, so when the generator is resumed (by calling `next()`), the function picks up where it left off, rather than starting from the beginning.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Generator Function**:\n",
        "A generator function is a function that contains one or more `yield` expressions. When the function is called, it returns a generator object, which can then be used to iterate through the yielded values.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example of a Generator Function:**\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def count_up_to(max):\n",
        "    count = 1\n",
        "    while count <= max:\n",
        "        yield count  # Yield returns a value and pauses the function\n",
        "        count += 1  # The function resumes from here when next() is called\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using the generator\n",
        "counter = count_up_to(5)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Iterate over the generator using next()\n",
        "print(next(counter))  # Output: 1\n",
        "print(next(counter))  # Output: 2\n",
        "print(next(counter))  # Output: 3\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, `count_up_to` is a generator function that yields numbers starting from 1 up to a specified maximum (`max`). Each time `next()` is called, the function continues from where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Generator Expressions**:\n",
        "Generator expressions are similar to list comprehensions but use parentheses instead of square brackets. They are a concise way to define simple generators.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example of a Generator Expression:**\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This generator expression produces the square of each number from 0 to 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Do Generators Work?\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call a generator function or expression, it doesn't execute the code immediately. Instead, it returns a **generator object**. This object is an iterator, so you can iterate over it with `next()`, or use it in a loop (`for` loop).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`yield`**: When the generator function encounters the `yield` statement, it sends a value to the caller and suspends execution. The state of the function (including local variables) is saved.\n",
        "- **`next()`**: Calling `next()` on a generator resumes the functionâ€™s execution from where it left off and continues until the next `yield` is encountered, at which point it yields another value.\n",
        "- **`StopIteration`**: When the generator runs out of values to yield (i.e., the function reaches the end or a `return` statement), it raises the `StopIteration` exception to signal the end of the iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Advantages of Generators:\n",
        "1. **Memory Efficiency**: Since generators yield one item at a time, they don't need to store the entire sequence in memory. This is especially useful when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "2. **Lazy Evaluation**: The values are generated only when needed, which can improve performance when you donâ€™t need to process every value in a sequence.\n",
        "3. **Clean and Concise Code**: Generators can simplify code that would otherwise involve writing more complicated logic for handling iteration and state management.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example: Fibonacci Generator\n",
        "\n",
        "A classic example of a generator is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Hereâ€™s how you can define it using a generator:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def fibonacci():\n",
        "    a, b = 0, 1\n",
        "    while True:\n",
        "        yield a  # Yield the current value of a\n",
        "        a, b = b, a + b  # Update a and b to the next two numbers in the sequence\n",
        "\n",
        "# Using the Fibonacci generator\n",
        "fib = fibonacci()\n",
        "for _ in range(10):\n",
        "    print(next(fib))  # Output the first 10 Fibonacci numbers\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, the generator `fibonacci` yields numbers indefinitely. Using `next()`, we can fetch the next Fibonacci number on demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "- **Generators** allow for lazy iteration over a potentially large (or infinite) sequence of data.\n",
        "- They are defined using functions with the `yield` keyword or with generator expressions.\n",
        "- The main advantages of generators include memory efficiency and lazy evaluation, making them suitable for working with large datasets or streams of data.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Memory Efficiency**: Generators yield values one at a time and do not store the entire sequence in memory, making them ideal for large datasets or infinite sequences. Regular functions often create and return entire collections, consuming more memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators compute and return values only when needed, which can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary calculations and allowing immediate processing of data without waiting for the entire sequence to be generated.\n",

        "- **Transformation**: The `map()` function is used to transform or modify each item in an iterable based on a function.\n",
        "  \n",
        "### Usage:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example: Using map() to square each number in a list\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers)\n",
